      Hello...my name is Caius and I welcome you to this little <b>tucked-away</b> corner of the net. I am creating this site in order to share various <b>interesting and exciting tidbits</b>, as well as learn  about the basics of building websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby. I don't have very specific designs or timelines for this project except <b>the vague, nebulous idea of creating a repository</b> of various ideas and aspects of life I appreciate and would find pleasurable to dawdle on! See you around as this site <b>slowly</b> grows!
