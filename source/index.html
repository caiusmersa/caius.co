      Hello...my name is Caius and I welcome you to this little tucked-away corner of the net. I am creating this site in order to share various <b>interesting and exciting tidbits</b>, as well as learn  about the basics of building websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby. I don't have very specific goals or timelines for this project except the vague idea of creating a repository of various ideas and things I find it pleasurable to dawdle on! See you around as this site slowly grows!

    <h3>Math stuff</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="pages/DragonFractal.html">Dragon curve</a> - a favorite <b>fractal</b>.
          I remember first seeing this as a kid on the pages of Jurassic Park (the book)!

        <li>
          <a href="pages/Lind.jar">LIND</a> - a <b>graphing calculator</b> I made long ago.
          This is a JAR file that will run using Java on your computer, not in the web browser.
          One of the neat features is it allows you to define functions and constants in terms of each other.
