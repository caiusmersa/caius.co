      Hello...my name is Caius and I welcome you to this little <b>tucked-away</b> corner of the net. I am creating this site in order to share various <b>interesting and exciting tidbits</b>, as well as learn  about the basics of building websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby. I don't have very specific designs or timelines for this project except <b>the vague, nebulous idea of creating a repository</b> of various ideas and aspects of life I appreciate and would find pleasurable to dawdle on! See you around as this site <b>slowly</b> grows!

    <h3>Math stuff</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="pages/DragonFractal.html">Dragon curve</a> - a favorite <b>fractal</b>. I remember first seeing this as a kid on the pages of Jurassic Park (the book)!
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="pages/Lind.jar">LIND</a> - a <b>graphing calculator</b> I made long ago. This is a JAR file that will run using Java on your computer, not in the web browser. One of the neat features is it allows you to define functions and constants in terms of each other.
      </ul>
    <h3>Other really dorky stuff</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://corylogan.com">My friend and webhost Cory</a> - he's a programmer, grinner, motorcyclist, and <b>all around swell guy</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
